<h1>“Filling the Gap” — Flagship</h1>
<p class="lede">Where depletion ruled, we build accumulation; where exclusion stood, we build belonging.</p>
<div class="badge">Private — invitation only</div>

<h2>The Gap</h2>
<p>For decades, mainstream rails optimised for <em>spend</em> and real-time <em>depletion</em>. The financially excluded
experienced volatility without the counterweight of structured accumulation. Advice was offered without an
infrastructure capable of holding the change.</p>

<h2>The Answer</h2>
<p><strong>CSS — Community Savings Solution</strong> is a safeguarded, never-spent savings architecture that restores cadence,
credibility, and consent. It treats <em>savings</em> as a first-class product — built to hold steady under real life.</p>

<h2>The Bridge</h2>
<p><strong>BAC — Bridge Across Community</strong> is the distribution and onboarding channel into churches, employers, and
community organisations. It’s where Cornwall’s <em>Community ONE</em> begins — quietly, locally, and repeatably.</p>

<h2>First Light</h2>
<p>The Chairperson stands at the level of <strong>Saver One</strong> — the first family — quietly but with fierce intent to see
them begin. There is no time clock; the act is authorship. Momentum starts with consent, safeguards, and a first
advance that proves a restoration loop is possible.</p>

<h2>Finite Milestones → Replication</h2>
<p>M1 → consent &amp; safeguards. M1.5 → first advance. M2 → restoration cadence. Habit formation follows. Cornwall becomes
a living template: Community ONE by stealth, then a few more communities, then regional; national later.</p>
