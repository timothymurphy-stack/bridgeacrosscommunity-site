<h1>CSS Strategic Brief</h1>
<p class="badge">Private — invitation only</p>

<h2>Core Premise</h2>
<p><strong>CSS — Community Savings Solution</strong> treats <em>accumulation</em> as first-class infrastructure. Funds are
<strong>placed</strong> (advanced) but <strong>not consumed</strong>; they <em>return</em> via co-agreed restoration. Proof starts at human scale:
one family → a cohort → a community.</p>

<h2>Safeguarded Fund (Never-Spent)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Capital sits in a safeguarded structure with a clear restriction: never spent; only placed and restored.</li>
<li><strong>Placement rules:</strong> small, deliberate, verified eligibility; first loop is tightly coached.</li>
<li><strong>Restoration:</strong> schedule is co-agreed and humanly possible; early loops are short to build cadence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-Time Proof of Savings</h2>
<p>A mother in Community ONE saves <em>in the flow of her day</em>. After the school run, she saves £3.33; that amount
is made available in her savings account immediately. That evening, buying groceries, she saves another £5.62; by the
end of the day, her account shows £8.95 saved.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the safeguarded corpus is temporarily down by those amounts. At nightly settlement, when the
retailer’s SAIV batch file arrives, the system restores the corpus. To the saver, the experience is <strong>real-time
accumulation</strong>; to investors, the corpus is never spent — it restores daily. This is the mirror-image of debit/credit
rails: real-time discretionary saving, woven into daily life. Over months and quarters, the profile of such activity
becomes profound — enabling new product design by local partners.</p>

<h2>Eligibility &amp; Verification</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eligibility signals:</strong> residency in Community ONE, basic documentation, willingness to enter a restoration schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> practitioner-led (church/employer/CU) to keep it human, not bureaucratic.</li>
<li><strong>Safeguards:</strong> privacy by default; minimal data; clear consent; independent oversight.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Placements, Ratios &amp; Cadence</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start small:</strong> prove the loop, then repeat.</li>
<li><strong>Short intervals early:</strong> daily restorations establish habit and produce evidence quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Slippage handling:</strong> pause, re-plan, reduce size; dignity first, theatre never.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting Rhythm</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Chair + steward + practitioner one-page view: consents, placements, restorations, issues.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Quiet internal update: households in cadence, restoration rate, issues resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Oversight review; privacy compact audit ticks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Community ONE → Replication</h2>
<p>Community ONE is the lighthouse. We refine quietly; then a few more communities; then regional; <em>national later</em>.
Cornwall remains the template. Pattern: consent → placement → restoration → cadence → habit → replication.</p>
