<h1>Letter to the Chairperson</h1>
<p class="lede">If you are reading this, it is because you were already chosen in heart.</p>

<p>This is not a pitch. It is an invitation. An invitation to stand at the level of <strong>Saver One</strong> — the first
family — and to light what has not yet been lit. Your presence at that moment will author a cadence that cannot be
stopped.</p>

<p>You will not be asked to perform. You will be asked to witness, to author, to protect. To prove that a fund can be
safeguarded, never spent. To see one family begin — and to know that from their restoration loop, Cornwall will hold
a new template for community and finance.</p>

<p>What follows in this secure library are eight briefings. Each one shows a facet of the architecture — CSS, BAC, the
fund, the privacy compact, the replication pattern. But none of them carries the weight of this page. Because the act
that matters most is the act that only you can author: <em>the first light.</em></p>

<p>If you feel this call, then it was always you. You are already the Chairperson of Heart.</p>
