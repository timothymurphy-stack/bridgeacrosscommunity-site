<h1>Investor Positioning Brief — v4</h1>
<p class="lede">Twenty years of calls to reach the financially excluded; the structural answer begins in Cornwall.</p>
<div class="badge">Private — invitation only</div>

<h2>Genesis: The Call That Went Unanswered</h2>
<p>For over two decades, leaders have called for innovation to reach the financially excluded. In 2001, Ron Sandler’s
landmark review demanded new models for those left behind. Years later, during the WONGA crisis, Archbishop Justin
Welby challenged the financial system to act in favour of the poorest. And yet, the gap remained.</p>

<h2>Enter CSS and BAC</h2>
<p><strong>CSS — Community Savings Solution</strong> builds the infrastructure of accumulation where the status quo has engineered
depletion. <strong>BAC — Bridge Across Community</strong> is the distribution and onboarding channel through churches, employers,
and community organisations. Cornwall’s <em>Community ONE</em> is the template for replication.</p>

<h2>The First Light</h2>
<p>John Doerr’s OKR philosophy recognises that every great system begins with a single defining action. For us, that action
is the <strong>Chairperson of Heart</strong> standing at the level of <em>Saver One</em> — the first family — quietly, with fierce intent to
see them begin. That act authors the cadence of credibility.</p>

<h2>Finite, Defining Milestones</h2>
<p>Momentum becomes observable and trusted early: M1 → consent &amp; safeguards; M1.5 → first advance; M2 → restoration cadence
demonstrated; onward to habit formation. One household becomes ten, then fifty, then five hundred. Cornwall proves; replication follows.</p>
